# Verifiable Credentials Specification Map
diagrams and documentation on the relationship of verfiable credential related specifications.

The current release contains some of the most core specifications and their related specs in a diagram.
It does not yet address some of the items especially under DIF work groups for secure data storage, SIOP, Sidetree etc.

Corrections welcome. This is a work in progress. Contribute via filing of issues or a PR.

## Release
The current map is released in 3 formats.
- kumu.io at https://www.kumu.io/michaelruminer/vc-spec-map
- JPEG (.jfif)
- PDF


The current kumu.io map is in a personal workspace. This is likely only an interim home and will be moved in the future. Watch this README for changes.

Releases prior to v1.2.0 did not use kumu.io and instead used a diagrams.net/draw.io manually drawn map.
